In 2011, the employment rate for individuals aged 16 to 64 was approximately 70.1%. By the end of 2014, this rate had risen to a record high of 73%, with 30.8 million people employed.

A significant contributor to this positive trend was the increase in female employment. By the end of 2014, a record number of 14.4 million women were employed, resulting in an employment rate of 68.1% among women.

Educational attainment played a crucial role in employment outcomes during this period. Data from the 2011 Census revealed that 75.5% of individuals aged 25 to 64 in England and Wales were employed. However, employment rates varied significantly based on qualification levels. For those with no qualifications, the employment rate was 48.5%, whereas individuals with a degree-level qualification or higher had an employment rate exceeding 80%.

Geographical disparities were also evident. Inner London areas, such as Tower Hamlets, exhibited lower employment rates for individuals without qualifications, with only 30% employed. In contrast, regions like Eden in the North West had higher employment rates for the same group, reaching 67.2%. These differences may be attributed to the concentration of managerial and professional occupations in London, which often require higher qualifications.
